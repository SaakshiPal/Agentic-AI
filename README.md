# Agentic-AI

This repository tracks my learning journey in **Agentic AI**, focusing on building intelligent systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously using modern AI frameworks.

## Course Overview
I am following a structured **self-paced Agentic AI course** that covers concepts from foundational Python to advanced multi-agent systems and real-world applications.

## What I’m Learning
- Python fundamentals for AI development
- Difference between traditional AI models and Agentic AI
- Agent architectures and workflows
- Memory, reasoning, and planning in AI agents
- Tool usage and external system integration

## Tools & Frameworks
- LangChain
- LangGraph
- CrewAI
- Vector Databases
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LlamaIndex
- Workflow automation with n8n

## Hands-On Focus
- Building single-agent and multi-agent systems
- Implementing RAG pipelines
- Using vector databases for memory and retrieval
- Designing real-world Agentic AI use cases

## Goal
Develop the ability to **design, build, and deploy Agentic AI applications** that can solve real-world problems autonomously.

## Status
📌 Learning phase | Hands-on practice in progress
